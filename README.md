Epilepsy is a chronic disorder affecting the central nervous system. People with epilepsy are subject to epileptic seizures caused by abnormal electrical discharges in a group of brain cells.  Epilepsy is detected using an EEG showing abnormal patterns of brain waves. The brain waves are recorded and tested for seizure activities. Epilepsy seizure symptoms vary, with some being visually detectable as when you suffer from a convulsion or loss of consciousness. In some cases, the individual is monitored with strict care as the symptoms affecting the brain coordinates can be left unnoticed, being as simple as an individual staring at a wall or biting the tongue. Here we build a machine learning model to study the EEG waves of an individual and classify if he/she is suffering from an epileptic seizure or not.
